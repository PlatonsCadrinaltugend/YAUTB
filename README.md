### Originstory
It was a rainy sunday-afternoon when i suddenly felt like there is something missing on Twitch. An Idea was born. My own Twitch-Chatbot to control my music. After successfully implementing it for my own spotify, i was hyped to go even further - my bot should combine the best of other bots in itself - and even more Features. And since then i am constantly working to improve and optimize it.

### Currently available Features (28.01.2024)
* Controll the hosters music (add Songs to the Queue, skip songs, controll volume) for whitelisted users
* modactions (ban, unban, timeout, crossban) for whitelisted users
* whitelist users to make sure they can use all features (like music and modactioncontroll) 
* automod (to automatically ban Users that are identified to be Bots by a very high chance)

### Currently planned Features
* enable spotify control for everyone if they log in
* add 7tv compatibility
* possibility to send livemessages whenever specific channel go live
* overview over all available commands
